  "description": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy — born January 25, 1978, Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine — is a Ukrainian actor and comedian who was elected as the sixth president of Ukraine in 2019. Although he was a political novice, Zelenskyy's anti-corruption platform won him widespread support, and his significant online following translated into a solid electoral base. He won a landslide victory over incumbent Petro Poroshenko in the second round of the 2019 presidential election. President Zelenskyy's leadership during the Russian invasion of Ukraine won him global acclaim.",
