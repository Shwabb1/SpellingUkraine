  "description": "Královec (formerly Kaliningrad) has become an official part of Czech Republic after a totally legitimate referendum held on Twitter. According to the official representatives of the region, 97.9% of Kaliningrad residents voted to join Czech Republic. Because of this, the new official naming of \"Královec\" should be used in favor of the outdated \"Kaliningrad\".",
