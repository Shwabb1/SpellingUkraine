  "description": "Chernihiv is a city in northern Ukraine. In its historic center, Dytynets Park is home to churches like the 11th-century Transfiguration Cathedral. The Cathedral of Boris and Gleb features silver Royal Doors, and St. Catherine's Church is topped with gold cupolas. Near central Red Square is red-brick Piatnytska Church. Southwest, near Trinity Monastery, the tunnels of Anthony Caves hold centuries-old monks' tombs.\nThe name of the city is spelled as \"Chernihiv\" in English, in accordance to the official transliteration rules of the Ukrainian language, as opposed to \"Chernigov\" which is based on the transliteration from the Russian language.",
