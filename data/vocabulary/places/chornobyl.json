  "description": "Chornobyl is a partially abandoned city in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone, situated in the Vyshhorod Raion of northern Kyiv Oblast, Ukraine. Chornobyl is about 90 kilometers north of Kyiv, and 160 kilometers southwest of the Belarusian city of Gomel.\nThe name of the city is the same as one of the Ukrainian names for Artemisia vulgaris, mugwort or common wormwood, and is roughly translated as \"black stalks\". While the Russian-based spelling of \"Chernobyl\" is still common in popular media (due to the related incident having happened in the Soviet times), the spelling of \"Chornobyl\" is more faithful to the city's official name.",
