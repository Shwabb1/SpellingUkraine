The Mykolaiv Observatory, founded in 1821, includes a museum with antique astronomical instruments. The Mykolaiv Zoo has tigers and polar bears. The Museum of Shipbuilding and Fleet traces the history of the city's main industry.\nThe city is named after Sviatyi Mykolai (Saint Nicholas), the patron of seafarers.
