  "description": "Lviv is a city in western Ukraine, around 70 kilometers from the border with Poland. Traces of its Polish and Austro-Hungarian heritage are evident in its architecture, which blends Central and Eastern European styles with those of Italy and Germany. In High Castle Park, the mountaintop ruins of a 14th-century castle provide panoramic views of the city's green-domed churches and the surrounding hills.\nThe city is named in honour of Leo, the eldest son of Daniel, King of Ruthenia. It's spelled as \"Lviv\" in English and not \"Lvov\" — the latter being a spelling derived from the Russian language.",
